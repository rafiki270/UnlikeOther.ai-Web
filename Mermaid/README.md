# Mermaid Static Site

This folder hosts static Mermaid diagram projects. Each client lives in its own
subfolder (for example, `adgoes.live/`).

Auth options and deployment notes live in `Mermaid/AUTH.md`. If you need basic
auth with a fixed username and password, start with
`Mermaid/nginx/mermaid-basic-auth.conf`.
